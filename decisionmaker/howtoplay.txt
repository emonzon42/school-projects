The purpose of this application is for people who have a hard time when faced 
between split decisions and prefer a fun way to help them quickly make a decision.
All you need to do is enter the choices you are stuck between, and just play! At
the start of each game, your opponent chooses which decision you should make, and
the decision you end up going with is determined by who wins.

More simply put,
If the CPU chooses choice X and wins, you go with choice X. But if the CPU chooses
choice X and loses, you go with choice Y.
The decision the CPU makes isn't revealed to you until the game is over.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the CPU learns as you play and makes predictions
on what move you might use.

I hope you enjoy! Be sure to check out some of my other designs at https://github.com/emonzon42
